# Super Agent — Top-of-Tree Consolidator

The super agent sits at depth 0 of the chaos-test tree. It is the only level that:
- Reads the consolidated tree of all orchestrator + actor findings
- Loads historical chaos runs for cross-run trend analysis
- Computes before/after deltas (resolved / persistent / new)
- Generates the final actionable report and recommends a fix plan

## When you (Claude) are running as Super Agent

You will see this frontmatter:

```yaml
---
role: super-agent
depth: 0
parent: null
max_depth: 3
run_id: chaos-<timestamp>
my_id: super-root
task: "Audit toolkit health and produce consolidated cross-run report"
allowed_to_decompose: true
---
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Spawn orchestrators
Default tri-fold (see orchestrator.md):
- `orch-code` — code quality
- `orch-behavior` — LLM behavior + UX
- `orch-architecture` — system design

Spawn all three in parallel via Agent tool calls in a single message. Each gets `depth: 1` and the proper frontmatter.

### Step 2: Wait for completion
Each orchestrator will spawn its own children (actors), aggregate them, and write its own findings file. You do NOT need to manage the children directly — that's the orchestrator's job.

### Step 3: Run the hierarchical aggregator
Once all your immediate children have completed:

```bash
node ~/Documents/claude-toolkit/swarm/hierarchical-aggregate.js {run_id}
```

This:
- Traverses the entire node-*.md tree
- Computes roll-up severity counts at every level
- Detects the previous run automatically (or use `--previous <id>`)
- Computes deltas: **resolved** / **new** / **persistent** findings
- Renders `hierarchical-report.md` with:
  - Current run summary
  - Before/after delta table
  - Tree visualization (ASCII)
  - Per-node findings index

### Step 4: Run the compliance probe
```bash
bash ~/.claude/scripts/compliance-probe.sh --last-24h
```

This shows whether Claude actually USED the toolkit hooks during the chaos test (vague prompts flagged vs enrichments stored).

### Step 5: Synthesize the consolidated report
Write your findings file:

`~/Documents/claude-toolkit/swarm/run-state/{run_id}/node-super-root.md`

Required structure:

```markdown
---
id: super-root
role: super-agent
depth: 0
parent: null
task: "<task>"
children: ["orch-code", "orch-behavior", "orch-architecture"]
---

# Super Agent Consolidated Report — {run_id}

## Executive Summary
[3-5 sentences: overall toolkit health, biggest improvement vs prior run,
biggest remaining concern, recommended next phase]

## Cross-Run Trend
| Metric | Run -2 | Run -1 | Current | Trend |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|-------|
[Pull from past hierarchical-report.md files in run-state/]

## What Improved
[Bullet list of resolved findings from the hierarchical aggregator]

## What's Persistent (not yet fixed)
[Bullet list — these need attention]

## What's New (regressions or new gaps)
[Bullet list — investigate why these appeared]

## Compliance Snapshot
[Paste output of compliance-probe.sh, interpret it]

## Recommended Next Phase
[1-3 high-leverage changes, ranked by impact]
```

### Step 6: Return brief summary to user
Final assistant message: 3-5 bullet points. Do NOT recapitulate the report — point the user to it and surface the most critical action.

## Why this is hierarchical, not flat

A flat swarm (5 actors → 1 aggregator) loses information at the boundary. Each persona has its own framing and severity threshold; flat aggregation just stacks them.

A hierarchical swarm:
- **Each orchestrator** can identify cross-cutting patterns within its area (e.g., "both the Hacker and Code Reviewer flagged file-locking issues — that's a code-quality theme")
- **The super agent** can identify cross-area patterns (e.g., "code quality is improving but compliance is plateauing")
- **The recursion limit** prevents the structure from collapsing into chaos
